# Healthcare Staff Secure (HSS)  
**🏆 3rd Place – ITWeb Security Summit Hackathon 2025**  
**Team: CyberTransformers**

**Healthcare Staff Secure (HSS)** is a security-first access control platform tailored for healthcare environments. It ensures only authorized staff access critical systems and patient data by integrating robust authentication, AI-powered support, and intelligent behavior monitoring.

## 📘 Project Overview

HSS addresses the growing need for secure healthcare IT environments by combining strong authentication measures, intelligent access management, and proactive AI incident response. The system is designed to reduce insider threats and enhance compliance in medical settings.

---

## 🔐 Core Features

- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** Strengthens identity verification through layered authentication steps.
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Assigns permissions based on professional roles (e.g., medical staff vs. administrative users).
- **AI Security Chatbot:** Delivers real-time security alerts, system guidance, and best practices to users.
- **Behavioral Anomaly Detection:** Analyzes login patterns, flags suspicious activities, and auto-triggers alerts or temporary account suspensions.
